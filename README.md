# ML_Project4

## Developers: Adam Terwilliger, Josh Engelsma
## Version: 1.0
## Purpose: CIS 678 - Machine Learning Project 4
## Details: Exploring Properties of Neural Networks (learning rate, number of epochs, train/test split)
## Credits: Grand Valley State University, Greg Wolffe

### Completed:
- Forward propagation
- Backward propogation
- 100% accuracy on iris on training data
- Make code modular to pass parameters in command line (num_epochs, learning_rate, training/test)
- Clean up other two datasets
- Run on other two datasets
- Find other "big" dataset
- Run on other "big" dataset
- Generate graph with weights colored
- Combine pngs into gif
- Bash script to run one-way parameter diff
- Generate more attractive gif for iris dataset
- Bash script to run two-way parameter diff
- Design doc
- Excel graphs to show parameter differences
